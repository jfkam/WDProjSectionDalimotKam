#### Home page: This provides an overview of the contents of the website. This will be the default page flashed on the screen, after the log in/sign in process. 
#### About: This page provides a detailed explanation on what mental health is, its signs, possible factors/causes, and the forms it comes in.
#### Need Help?: This page is allocated for emphasizing on the effects of mental health, a commonly seen outcome -- suicide, along with ways to help solve these problems, and contact information of counseling and hospitals.
#### Vent Space: This page is a freedom wall in a sense but more on venting out problems. It will be divided into two subpages being "My Diary" and "Send a Note", these subpages or features will be simple to do and understand on the end of the user.
#### Gallery: This page will flash a bunch of pictures, quotes,  illustrations, and other motivational materials to enlighten the mood of the user when viewing them.

### Additional Information
#### At the start of the website, there will be a log in/sign in process which is designed for the website to feel more realistic.
#### In most webpages, there will be a series of abstracts (clouds, shooting star, letter/envelope, and/or a book) that will unfold detailed explanations when the user hovers/clicks on them.
##### The footer will always contain the copyright as well as the authors' personal information.

### JS Incorporation
#### JavaScript will be incorporated into the VentSpace feature of the website to make it interactive and have a good data flow. It will handle real-time personal “diary” entries and form submissions for anonymous confessions or “vents” without requiring the user to reload the page. Using the coding language, the site can display shared “vents” and store personal “diary” entries locally while ensuring anonymity by using an individual’s username.  JavaScript will also incorporate customization of the page using pre-defined themes based on someone's mood.  These functions make VentSpace an engaging way to express a person's thoughts and find comfort through others’ experiences.
#### JavaScript will also be used for the Log In portion of the website for it to function properly.  The coding language will be used to verify whether the user filled out all required information before submitting the info to be processed.  In addition, a small icon will be added that allows password visibility and vice versa.  It will also store usernames locally so that users don't have to retype their information every time they log in the site. This will allow the Log In page to be functional and easy to use while protecting the user's identity.

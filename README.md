### Description 
#### Are You Okay: A Check-Up on Us is a website centered around mental health awareness with a goal of giving users a simple and convenient way to care for their emotional well-being. It aims to create a safe and supportive space for people to seek help and connect with others for understanding. It provides accessible information on common mental health issues, their causes, signs and effects through simple guides. It includes features to make mental wellness more engaging such as VentSpace–an attribute of the site which can either be used as a personal diary or anonymous confession board. This site’s purpose is to motivate people to pay attention to their mental health and ensure that every user leaves the browser more relaxed than before.

### Breakdown
#### Log in/Sign in page: This page is like any other ordinary log in/sign in system. It will ask the user for a personalized username and password. The username will be then displayed in the succeeding webpages.
#### Home page: This provides an overview of the contents of the website. This will be the default page flashed on the screen, after the log in/sign in process. 
#### About: This page provides a detailed explanation on what mental health is, its signs, possible factors/causes, and the forms it comes in.
#### Need Help?: This page is allocated for emphasizing on the effects of mental health, a commonly seen outcome -- suicide, along with ways to help solve these problems, and contact information of counseling and hospitals.
#### Vent Space: This page is a freedom wall in a sense but more on venting out problems. It will be divided into two subpages being "My Diary" and "Send a Note", these subpages or features will be simple to do and understand on the end of the user.
#### Gallery: This page will flash a bunch of pictures, quotes,  illustrations, and other motivational materials to enlighten the mood of the user when viewing them.
#### Sources: This page will contain all of the sources used in the project.
*****
### Additional Information
#### At the start of the website, there will be a log in/sign in process which is designed for the website to feel more realistic.
#### In most webpages, there will be a series of abstracts (clouds, shooting star, letter/envelope, and/or a book) that will unfold detailed explanations when the user hovers/clicks on them.
##### The footer will always contain the copyright as well as the authors' personal information.
*****
### JS Incorporation
#### JavaScript will be incorporated into the VentSpace feature of the website to make it interactive and have a good data flow. It will handle real-time personal “diary” entries and form submissions for anonymous confessions or “vents” without requiring the user to reload the page. Using the coding language, the site can display shared “vents” and store personal “diary” entries locally while ensuring anonymity by using an individual’s username. JavaScript will also incorporate customization of the page using pre-defined themes based on someone's mood. These functions make VentSpace an engaging way to express a person's thoughts and find comfort through others’ experiences.
#### JavaScript will also be used for the Log In portion of the website for it to function properly. The coding language will be used to verify whether the user filled out all required information before submitting the info to be processed. In addition, a small icon will be added that allows password visibility and vice versa. It will also store usernames locally so that users don't have to retype their information every time they log in the site. This will allow the Log In page to be functional and easy to use while protecting the user's identity.

Once they click the "Done" button at the bottom of the screen, they will be transported to the next webpage–"Results".

## Details
### In our three new proposed webpages, we will use HTML forms with many different functions in each one.  For the first webpage called Mental Health Quiz, we will use HTML forms through a multiple choice quiz.  The multiple choice quiz will use radio buttons to represent the choices for each question in the test.  The data collected from the user's answers in the HTML form will be saved in the broswer's localStorage using JavaScript.  We will represent the data we collected from the HTML forms in the other two new webpages using comprehensible diagrams and straightforward suggestions.  
### In our second webpage named Results, the data from the HTML form; in this case; the user's anxiety and depression levels are represented through a horizontal status bar and drop down text created using HTML.  In our third webpage entitled Next Steps, the data from the HTML form will be used to generate  personalized observations, suggestions and comments to assist the user in taking the next step to improve their mental health.  These recommendations will be represented using drop down text boxes.  
### CSS animations and Javascript's localStorage will be applied in all three of these webpages to further advance the user's experience with the website and will immerse him or her in the journey in cultivating their emotional health.

## Definition of Done (Finished Website)
### The website will be considered finished when a set of objectives that me and my partner have created are all achieved.  Firstly, the three webpages are connected to each other using hyperlinks in the form of buttons that are found at the bottom of a screen.  The first webpage is considered finished if it's a fully functional HTML quiz that collects data using the HTML elements and uses JavaScript to save this data in the localStorage.  The second webpage is considered complete if it successfully gathers the data from the first webpage's quiz and creates a status bar that represents the anxiety and depression level of a person based on the computed data from the quiz.  The third webpage is considered complete if the data from the first webpage flows perfectly to this one and if this data is used to create personalized statements about the user's mental health and how they can take the next steps in improving their emotional health.  
### A settings or control center button will also be placed at the upper right area of the website with the options of inputting and changing your username, password and email as well as logging out or switching your account.  Our website must also be capable of working on both phones and laptops to allow the user easier access to the website which would in turn, assist them in improving their psychological well-being–the main purpose of this website.
